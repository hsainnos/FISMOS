## Internal FISMOS memory map:


| Address Range            | Description                             |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| 0x0000_0000 : 0x0300_0000 | Internal SRAM                           |
| 0x0400_0000 | 32bit Output from PicoRV32                           |
| 0x0500_0000 : 0xFeFF_FFFF| Reserved for Additional Security Hardware                           |
| 0xFF00_0000 | FISMOS Instruction Register (32bit)                           |
| 0xFF00_0004 | Return Register (32bit)                           |
| 0xFF00_0008 : 0xFFFF_FFFF | Shared Memory                           |

> As seen from the PicoRV32 processor. These addresses are used in the [Firmware](sw/Readme.md).

## AXI Interface

| Address Range            | Description                             |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| AXI_BASE_ADDRESS + 0x00 | FISMOS Instruction Register (32bit)                           |
| AXI_BASE_ADDRESS + 0x04 | Return Register (32bit)                           |
| AXI_BASE_ADDRESS + 0x08 | Start of Shared Memory                           |

> As seen from the external AXI4-Lite connection. These addresses are used in the Linux [Software](sw/Readme.md).  
> AXI_BASE_ADDRESS is configured via `TCL` script or chosen manually during synthesis

## Acknowledgement and Dependencies

Motivation of the presented FISMOS is to overcome the need for external components for security features.
In case, [OpenTitan](https://opentitan.org/) seems a little overpowered or too big for the considered design, the FISMOS might be ideal.
Furthermore, the proposed system might replace external secure elements, like basic functions of a TPM or [ATECC](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/ATECC608B).

The FISMOS is implemented on the programmable logic inside a SoC, It is utilizing surplus elements, adding a trusted environment to the ARM cores.
Communicating to Linux on mentioned cores, the FISMOS is connected via the [AXI4-Lite](https://www.xilinx.com/products/intellectual-property/axi_lite_ipif.html) bus, either directly or via a LKM.
This repository was created during the [MAPR](https://www.hs-augsburg.de/en/Electrical-Engineering/Applied-Research-in-Engineering-Sciences-MSc.html) of Philipp Schubaur at [HSA_innos](https://hsainnos.de) and was financally funded by [SiS 4.0](https://www.fim-rc.de/en/sis-4-0-secure-industry-4-0-in-swabia/).

This project was inspired by the [PicoSoc](https://github.com/YosysHQ/picorv32) from Cliffard Wolf, as well as basic structures for [AXI Components](https://github.com/alexforencich/verilog-axi) from Alex Forencich in combination with tutorials from [ZipCPU](https://zipcpu.com/).

Long-term, programming in `Rust` is considered as well as making use of dedicated security modules in programmable logic.
